    "Q1. MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance. Non-relational databases, like MongoDB, store and retrieve data in a format other than traditional tabular relations used in SQL databases. They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable for scenarios where data models may change frequently or where scalability and performance are crucial. MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios such as real-time analytics, content management systems, mobile applications, and social networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a) Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for dynamic schemas and easy data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Scalability: It supports horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple servers, enabling high performance and handling large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) High Availability: MongoDB provides automatic replication and failover, ensuring data availability even in the event of server failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Flexible Data Model: It supports nested documents, arrays, and key-value pairs, allowing for complex data structures and hierarchical relations\n",

    "Q3. Here's an example code to connect MongoDB to Python, create a database, and a collection:"
