    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1. To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, you can use the formula for the confidence interval:\n",
    "Confidence Interval = (sample mean) ± (critical value) * (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to determine the critical value based on the desired confidence level (95% in this case). You can refer to a Z-table or use the scipy.stats module in Python to find the critical value. The sample size is not provided in the question, so you may need to assume a sample size or clarify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. To conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test, you need to compare the observed frequencies (colors of M&Ms in the bag) with the expected frequencies (the given distribution). You can calculate the chi-square statistic using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "chi-square = Σ((observed frequency - expected frequency)^2 / expected frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can compare the calculated chi-square value with the critical chi-square value at the desired significance level (0.05 in this case) and degrees of freedom (number of categories - 1) to determine if there is a significant difference. You can use the scipy.stats module in Python to perform the chi-square test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. To calculate the chi-square statistic and p-value for a contingency table, you can use the scipy.stats module in Python. The contingency table provided in the question represents the observed frequencies. The chi-square test will determine if there is a significant association between the two groups (Group A and Group B). The calculated chi-square value can be compared with the critical chi-square value at the desired significance level (0.05) and degrees of freedom (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of individuals who smoke in the population, you can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = (sample proportion) ± (critical value) * sqrt((sample proportion * (1 - sample proportion)) / sample size)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to determine the critical value based on the desired confidence level (95% in this case). The sample proportion is calculated as the number of individuals who smoke divided by the total sample size. The sample size is provided in the question (500).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Similar to Q1, you can calculate the 90% confidence interval for a sample with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 12 using the formula for the confidence interval. You will need to determine the critical value based on the desired confidence level (90% in this case). The sample size is not provided in the question, so you may need to assume a sample size or clarify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. To plot the chi-square distribution with 10 degrees of freedom in Python, you can use the scipy.stats module. You can specify the degrees of freedom and use the pdf function to plot the probability density function. You can also shade the area corresponding to a chi-square statistic of 15 by calculating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) up to that point and shading the corresponding area under the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. To calculate a 99% confidence interval for the true proportion of people in the population who prefer Coke, you can use the same formula as in Q4. The sample proportion is calculated as the number of people who prefer Coke divided by the total sample size. The sample size is provided in the question (1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. To conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test for the coin flipping experiment, you need to compare the observed frequencies (number of tails) with the expected frequencies (50% tails and 50% heads for a fair coin). You can calculate the chi-square statistic using the formula provided in Q2. Then, compare the calculated chi-square value with the critical chi-square value at the desired significance level (0.05) and degrees of freedom (number of categories - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. To conduct a chi-square test for independence for the smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis, you can use the scipy.stats module in Python. The contingency table provided in the question represents the observed frequencies. The chi-square test will determine if there is a significant association between smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis. The calculated chi-square value can be compared with the critical chi-square value at the desired significance level (0.05) and degrees of freedom (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Similar to Q9, you can conduct a chi-square test for independence to determine if there is a significant association between chocolate preference and country of origin. The contingency table provided in the question represents the observed frequencies. The calculated chi-square value can be compared with the critical chi-square value at the desired significance level (0.01) and degrees of freedom (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. To conduct a hypothesis test for the population mean, you can use a t-test since the population standard deviation is unknown. You can calculate the t-value using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (sample mean - hypothesized mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n",
    "Then, compare the calculated t-value with the critical t-value at the desired significance level (0.05) and degrees of freedom (sample size - 1) to determine if the population mean is significantly different from the hypothesized mean.\n"
